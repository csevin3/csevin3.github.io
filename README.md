# Programming Digital Media Final Project
Below is the complete documentation of my final project

## Outline
- This project is a simple RPG battle game created in p5.js, Javascript and Arduino. It is coded in Javascript, HTML, and the Arduino language. In this game you select your action using either your mouse or your the arduino joystick. The player must defeat the enemy slime to win. The game also incorporates the LED lights from the Arduino that activate when you use certain actions.

## NarrativeDescription
- The goal of this game is to defeat the enemy slime. There are four different options that you can pick from: Punch, Fireball, Charge, and Heal. The player starts off with 100 health points and 50 mana points that become depleted as you fight the slime depending on what happens in the game. Whenever you use charge, the blue LED activates, and whenever you use heal, the green LED activates.
